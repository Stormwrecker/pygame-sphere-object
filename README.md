\#Pygame Sphere Object



The follow program creates a sphere-looking object using Pygame-CE. How it really works is that it takes an image,

slices it into 1 x 'your-height' and places them onto a circular track. Each segment then is sorted according to z depth for blitting.

Manipulating `Sphere.master\_angle` will move the slices up and down the track and give the illusion of a 3D spherical object.



I've added a stretch effect just to add a more natural feel to the object's movement. To create an image for the

`Sphere`, simply figure out your height (say 16px), multiply that by Ï€ (say ~51px), and that will be sufficient for

'wrapping' around the whole object.



Hopefully, it's generic enough for you to be able to use it somewhere in your own projects.





\## Notes



When blitting an object, make sure that you blit to `display` and NOT screen. The `display` is the actual canvas that

everything gets drawn on. Then the display is scaled to fit the window, perfect for pixel artists.



Using Pygame (not -CE) will result in your sphere object having a red background as I set color-key to red for the image.



Have fun experimenting with this technique, but please give credit if used!
